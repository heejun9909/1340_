problem statement & problem setting

Nowadays,a lot of retailers are having troubles with the suppliers because of late re-stock of commodities and unexpected events such as difference in the quantities of supplied and required commodities. In addition, for some popular items that are selling very fast, they tend to miss considerable number of customers because of the time gap caused by re-stock process.

Futhermore, manual mistakes often happen if retail shops performing inventory management works manually . For example, when the staffs who in charge of managing inventory mark a incorrect expiration date or they just haven't keep tracking on the expiration date . There would be a lots of goods become obsolete and finally it is forced to discard all of them. That would be a big loss from owner's perspective.

After that ,hiding staff for commodity inventory management is kind of inefficiency usage of human resources . Since human can never perform better than a automatic system on counting/tracking data. Furthermore ,applying inventory management system can save the cost of hiding staff on managing inventory . The saved money can also expend on other area such as promotion work.

program features that we would like to implement(other than the features included in idea 2):

Tracking & reminding function on expiry date: Our program will keep tracking the expiration date of commodity and send notice to the owner when it's X(setup by owners) days before the expiration date. Then the owners can prevent wasting the goods by lowering the price to increase the rate of sales or just donating it to Non-profit organization(NPO).This feature is especially useful for retail shops that selling foods and drink(e.g milk)

Restocking popular inventory automatically before it's out-of-stock: Our program would be able to send order to supplier automatically when the inventory of a specific popular commodity has been decreased to a certain amount(setup by owners). Given that the owner can decide this function to be acted on which commodity and the amount that cause function of sending order to supplier automatically . This feature can ensure quick restock on popular items before the goods become out-of-stock.Which can prevent loss of customers due to the time gap from the moment when the commodity become out-of-stock to finish restocking.

Accounting function of calculating profit: Other than storing datas of (name, manufacturer, amount, price, availability of shop(s)).Our program would also store the cost(ordering cost) of commodity and recording every single sales in real-time(record it each day if not able to record it in real-time). Then our program will calculate and store the profits by ((No.of sales*price)-cost) on every commodity automatically. Total profits could also be obtained by sum-up the profits of all of the commodity in a retail shop.
